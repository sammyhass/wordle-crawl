# wordler
<3 to Josh Wardle for creating this absolutely gem of a game (and sorry)

--------------

* It should go without saying but if you play wordle and want to be smart not like me, you wont use this.
* This repo uses playwright to find the solution to wordle. There is no need to go searching through 
 a word list as we can find the solution extremely simply, as can be seen in `wordle.spec.ts`
 
* Solutions are uploaded once a day as issues. Every day, when the action is run, a new issue will be made for the day,
containing the solution for the wordle of that day.
